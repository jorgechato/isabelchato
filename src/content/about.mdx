I am a dedicated and curious Biotechnologist pursuing a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at Université Côte d'Azur, with over four years of hands-on research experience. I have a strong foundation in scientific data analysis, experimental design, and cell-based studies. I enjoy collaborating with others to solve complex scientific challenges.

Passionate about connecting science with real-world impact, my goal is to apply my expertise to advance biotech/pharmaceutical developments and contribute to meaningful solutions that improve lives.
